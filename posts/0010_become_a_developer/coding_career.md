# How I went from no coding experience to coding for a living in one year (a guide)

tags: python, career

## Introduction

I got my degree in Cellular Biology in 2012. For five years thereafter, I worked in research labs studying diseases like Cancer, HIV and diabetes. My co-workers were awesome. I was doing cool, cutting edge science. The pay was... not great, and the career advancement opportunities were similarly underwhelming. I was looking for a change to something more lucrative, with better opportunities for advancement. I had family and friends who were software developers. They told me it was an interesting career and it paid well. So I looked into it. How can I become a coder? üë®‚Äçüî¨‚û°üë®‚Äçüíª

At the start of June, 2017 I was a lab technician at the University of Colorado, and I had no coding experience. A year later, in June of 2018, I started my first job as a full time software developer. And I've loved my new career choice ever since. In this article, I'll talk about *how* I made that career pivot, and I'll give you some ideas about how you could make a similar career pivot if it is something that interests you.

## Why become a software developer?

## Am I smart enough to code?

The short answer, **yes you are**. Before I learned to code, I thought coding was magic. Super smart people wrote complex, arcane words, and my computer did awesome things. I thought you had to go to school for years and years of intensive drudgery to learn these secrets. And even then, only geniuses could really understand it. **Wrong!** You do not have to be a genius to learn to code. You do not even have to have above-average intelligence. You do not even need to be good at math.

Ultimately, coding can be super simple. If you have a complicated problem, you'll break it down into smaller problems. To do large task `A`, I need to do smaller task `B`, `C` and `D`. And all these smaller problems come down to simple logical statements directing a computer to do things. "computer: print 'hello world'", "computer: make this word green", "computer: add these two numbers together".

Yes, at first you *will* feel out of your depth. I certainly did when I started. Everyone does at first. There is a lot to learn. But learning to code is just like learning to dance or learning to play an instrument or any other skill. You get started learning the basics. And believe me, you can learn those basics. And once you are comfortable with those, you start learning stuff that's a little more complicated. But it's not so bad now because you already know those basics. And those skills keep building until, eventually, you are solving those cool, complicated problems. But they don't seem so hard anymore. And stuff that used to seem impossibly complicated is now simple. You'll learn it in small, easy to understand and digest chunks. And as concepts layer on top of each other, and as you practice what you learn, things get easier and easier.

## The three main paths to becoming a software developer

Before we talk about how I learned to code, let's talk about the options *anyone* has to learn to code. If you are looking to transition into software development there are three main paths to achieve this goal. You could (1) **get a college computer science (CS) degree**, (2) **train with a coding bootcamp**, or (3) **self-educate**. All three routes have strong advantages and disadvantages. The best path for one person might not be the best path for someone else. We'll briefly go over some of those advantages and disadvantages. My sources for these paths include the [*Command Line Heros*](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } podcast episode, ["Becoming a Coder"](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-5/becoming-a-coder){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }, the book [*The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide*](https://simpleprogrammer.com/products/careerguide/){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } by John Sonmez, the [stack overflow developer's survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#learning-to-code-learn-code){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }, [bestcolleges.com](https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/payment/bootcamp-cost/#comparison){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }, [thinkimpact.com](https://www.thinkimpact.com/average-college-tuition/){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }, and conversations I've had with other software developers and my own experiences. After this section, for the remainder of the article, we'll hone in on the route I took, **self-educating**. If that's all you're interested in, feel free to skip ahead to the next section where I talk about *how* I went about self-educating.

### College computer science (CS) degree

This is the big one. The most recent [stack overflow developer's survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#learning-to-code-learn-code){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } found that ~62% of developers learned to code through a college or university. Formal training with a computer science or similar degree is a *very* popular route. And for good reason. Individuals who earn a CS degree gain a deep understanding of computer theory as well as a deep understanding of code fundamentals. They get a guided program with lots of resources for help. And they get that shiny diploma that employers love along with networking opportunities like career fairs and internship programs. The downside? It can be very expensive, both in terms of money and time.

Who is the college CS degree path a good fit for? This path *can* be a good fit for anyone who feels confident about going into software development who has the time and resources to go to school (or back to school). I think it is a particularly good fit for individuals with no previous college degree since having any college degree can generally give individuals an advantage over individuals without one when seeking that first job. It's also a good fit if you really want to gain a deep understanding of computer theory and computer fundamentals. It might not be a good fit if you don't have the time and money to invest four years of your life with limited to no income.

Advantages:

- **Depth and Quality**: A CS degree is going to give the greatest depth of understanding of how computers work "under the hood". Because of this, someone with a CS degree is likely to have a serious leg-up with theoretical topics and fundamental, complex topics like complex data structures, algorithms. Many employers understand that this doesn't *always* translate to the skill of writing high-quality production code in a real-world job, but in some cases it might, and in all cases it certainly doesn't hurt.
- **Guidance**: The plan is laid out before you. You know what classes you need to take to achieve the degree. You have an instructor guiding you through the topics. You have TAs and other students to go to for help when you get stuck.
- **employability**: Some employers just want that CS degree. Certain employers won't even consider candidates without a CS degree, especially without other programming experience at a real job. Having the degree makes it that much easier getting your foot in the door at a quality company.
- **networking**: Many universities offer programs to assist their students in getting into a career. This might be career fairs, internship opportunities, or clubs or forums where students have chances to meet with employers.

Disadvantages:

- **Cost**: A university education might cost anywhere from $40K to well over $100K over 4 years, depending on the University and financial aide. Software developer jobs are notoriously lucrative, so you'll definitely be able to pay this back in short order, but as with any degree, there's the risk of dropping out without getting the degree and still having that bill.
- **Time**: An average bachelor's degree takes 4 years as a full-time student. That's kind of a long time. On top of that, you **aren't working** (at least full-time) during those 4 years, so you are missing out on income during that time.

### Coding bootcamp

That same [stack overflow developer's survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#learning-to-code-learn-code){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } found just over 10% of individuals learned to code through a coding bootcamp, but that number seems to be on an upward trend. What is a coding bootcamp? It's basically an intensive program that lasts anywhere from 4 weeks to several months where they take individuals with potentially no coding experience and teach them everything they know to be a proficient coder in real-world coding jobs. Many specialize in one coding language. They are generally much cheaper than the CS degree route and offer many of the same benefits, like set course schedules with guided classes and lots of help. They also usually help with job networking and placement so many of them have very high employment rates after graduation. However, because of their growing popularity, along with a lack of regulations for their programs, there are a subset of such coding bootcamps that are low quality and have poor job placement rates. You'll want to do thorough research of all your bootcamp options before picking the one that's right for you.

Who is the coding bootcamp path a good fit for? Overall, I think training at a coding bootcamp is a great option for *any* person wanting to transition their career into coding. It might be a good fit for you if you want to make that transition *quickly*, if you want help and accountability along the way to make sure you stick to your learning, and if you want extra help with networking to get that first job.

Advantages:

- **Time**: This is probably the fastest option to go from no coding experience to landing a coding job. Coding bootcamps can range in time from a month to a several months.
- **Full or part time**: While not as flexible as self-educating, different coding bootcamps have different time requirements. Most programs are full-time, immersive programs. However, some programs are part time, in the evenings, so you could work your day job and learn to code nights and/or weekends.
- **Cost**: Coding bootcamps are generally cheaper than going to a university. A several-month bootcamp will generally cost $10,000-$20,000. On top of that, some coding bootcamps won't charge anything until you land your first coding job. Some offer plans of no money down and with a money back guarantee if you don't find a job.
- **Guidance**: As with the CS degree, the plan is laid out before you. You have a set curriculum and a schedule. You have an instructor guiding you through the topics. You have teachers, TAs and other students to go to for help when you get stuck.
- **employability**: Some employers are sticklers for that 4-year college CS degree. But *many* employers have come around to the idea of coding bootcamps and will rank them on par with a quality CS degree when hiring new developers.
- **networking**: Coding bootcamps really want you to get a job after graduating. Most will facilitate employment networking opportunities and help you land that first job.

Disadvantages:

- **Cost**: I put this one in the advantage *and* disadvantage category. While overall, I think coding bootcamps are reasonably priced, they can't touch the low cost of self-educating. And in some cases, you might have to foot a large bill even if you *don't* land a job.
- **Inconsistent quality**: There are a lot of coding bootcamps out there that are **amazing**. üéâ But there are no real regulations around coding bootcamps, and there are also a plethora of coding bootcamps that are not very good or are even predatory. Do thorough research on any bootcamp before you sign that fine print.

### Self-education

The [stack overflow developer's survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#learning-to-code-learn-code){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } was a little confusing to determine who self-educated without the help of a CS degree or a bootcamp, but if we assume that the 3 categories don't significantly overlap, approximately 27% of developers learned via self-education. What does it mean to self-educated? The term is a little misleading. Obviously, you're learning from *someone*. But generally that learning comes from pre-recorded material, outside of the context of a broader program. This means learning from sources like one-off online courses, books, blogs, podcasts, videos, games, challenges, documentation, other people's code, etc. There is no curriculum set for you, no teacher or TA to ask for help from, and no set of assignments. Because these things are not provided for you, if you choose this route, you'll need to get those things yourself. You'll need to design *your own* curriculum, set *your own* schedule and learning pace, *find* a network of people you can ask for help from (or muddy through yourself), and assign *yourself* topics to learn and projects to build.

Who is this path good for? For one it might be a good starting path for *anyone*. Because this path is free (or very cheap by comparison), it is very low risk. Anyone thinking about coding might at least *start* on the **self-education** path and see what this coding thing is all about. If you do, you can always *transition* to a college CS degree or bootcamp and be no worse off than when you started. It might also be a good fit for you if you need to keep a full-time job and want to learn coding on the side at times that fit *your* schedule and that match *your* learning pace. While learning on your own schedule at your own pace can be one of the greatest *advantages* of self-educating for some, it can be a huge *disadvantage* for others. It means (1) you have to figure out a curriculum and schedule to get from where you are to where you want to be (not easy when you don't yet know what it is you need to learn), and (2) you have to keep *yourself* accountable to stick that curriculum and schedule. With no one holding you accountable, you might struggle to find the motivation to stay on course. All that is to say, **self-educating** might not be the best fit for you if you need extra help finding your learning path staying accountable to it. It also might not be the best fit for you if you find yourself needing lots of extra help from an authority figure or if you just don't like going it alone.

Advantages:

- **Cost**: This is the cheapest option by far. Costs can range from 100% *free* to a few hundred dollars depending on the resources you opt to use. Because costs are so low, this option is also very low risk. There's virtually no financial fallout starting this path and then later on deciding coding isn't for you.
- **Flexibility**: Learn on your own schedule and at your own pace. This is a massive advantage if you can't afford to quit your job to go to school or attend a coding bootcamp.

Disadvantages:

- **lack of networking**: There's no institution networking with companies on your behalf. You'll have to put in extra work to do the networking yourself.
- **Lack of guidance**: There's no one to tell you what to do and to make sure you're doing it right. You'll need to set your own curriculum, check your own work, and seek out your own network of people to ask for help from.
- **Lack of accountability**: There's no one making you do your work. If you aren't feeling motivated, you won't do the work you need to do to get to where you want to go.
- **More to prove**: I put this in the disadvantage category because *some* employers will be skeptical of the quality of self-educated individuals, especially for that first time job. Some won't even consider an individual who doesn't have a CS degree or bootcamp certificate. However, increasingly, more and more employers are becoming open to hiring individuals with no formal training as long as they can prove they know their stuff. Some even think it show chutzpah to not need any hand-holding to get to this level. Either way, you'll have to work a little harder to prove to that first employer that you're a good fit for the job.

### Education path conclusions

Those are the three main paths you can take to go from no coding experience to landing your first coding job. All paths are quite viable and there is no one *best* path. You'll have to decide what sounds best *for you*. There are serious advantages and disadvantages to each path, and you should do more research beyond this article before picking any one path. *I* chose the **self-education** path. It worked out well for me, but it was not easy. There was a lot of difficulty and uncertainty along the way. That **self-education** path is the path  we'll be talking about for the rest of this article. But even if you chose another path, I think some of the topics we'll discuss might be nice supplements to your coding education journey. And as I mentioned above. You can always *start* down the **self-education** path, and then transition to another path later on.

## Choosing a language

When it comes to coding, everyone has their favorite language. That makes sense. The language is the thing you use to *express* what it is you want the computer to do. And it's the thing you're working with for hours on end. You want to like it. And there are a *lot* of languages to choose from. Without knowing anything about them, how are you suppose to choose one that is right for *you*?

### Think about language popularity

Okay, just pick a language. But what even are my choices? I recommend picking one of the more popular languages. The more popular a language is, the more likely it is to have a big community to support you (think more courses, tutorials, and people to talk to). These are the top 10 most popular languages according to the [stack overflow developer's survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }. I pruned the actual list, removing languages that are more helper languages than full-fledged programming languages. The percentage attached is the percentage of respondents who use that language (out of over 70,000 respondents). Any language on this list would be a great choice for a first programming language in terms of popularity. Even if a language you're interested in *isn't* on this list, it still probably has a great community of support and would be a fine pick for a first language.

1. JavaScript (65%)
2. Python (48%)
3. Java (33%)
4. C# (28%)
5. C++ (23%)
6. PHP (20%)
7. C (19%)
8. Go (11%)
9. Rust (9%)
10. Kotlin (9%)

### Consider ease of use

One thing you might consider when picking a language is how easy that language is to learn. All languages aren't that bad once you get to know them. But some just seem to be easier out the gate. Maybe their syntax is more straightforward, their coding style is simpler, or they do more for you so you have less to think about. What makes a coding language "easy" and which languages are easy to learn vs which languages are hard to learn is *very* subject. Here's a list from [codingdogo.com](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/easiest-programming-language-to-learn){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" } for their picks of the top 5 easiest and top 5 hardest languages to learn. While I have only used a couple of the languages on this list, I tend to think these choices are reasonable from my limited experience and from talking to other developers. For *why* the site thinks these are easier and more difficult languages, you'll have to [read their article](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/easiest-programming-language-to-learn){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }.

Top 5 easiest to learn

1. Python
2. C
3. Ruby
4. Java
5. JavaScript

Top 5 hardest to learn

1. C++
2. Prolog
3. LISP
4. Haskell
5. Malbolge

### Consider language use case

If you have an idea of what *type* of programming you want to do, you might pick a language that is well suited for that job. Certain languages tend to be well suited for certain programming needs. Here's a list of some common programming needs, and languages that are well suited for them. This is another subjective area. Some people might consider other languages better for these jobs than the ones I chose. If that's you, or if your favorite language for a job isn't on my list, don't hate. üòõ I'm sure that's an awesome choice too.

Front-end web development (code running in your browser):

- **JavaScript**: This is basically the only language in town for this job alongside its spinoffs like **typescript** and its helper languages **HTML** and **CSS**.

Back-end web development (code running on a website server):

- **Node.js**: This language is basically the same as **javascript** with some subtle differences that allow it to run on a server. This is nice because then you can learn just one language for both front-end and back-end web development (ie full-stack web development).
- **Python**: There are tons of great web development frameworks that make Python an easy and excellent choice for web development. I'm a little biased because this is *my* language of choice.
- **PHP**: A veteran of the backend web space with a lot of web frameworks and large community.
- **C#**: The Microsoft programming language has a great community and great, opinionated backend frameworks.

Data Science:

- **Python**: The most popular data-science choice these days. Has great frameworks for easily processing large datasets and for data visualization. Is fast for these purposes (because they are written in **C** under the hood). Is the only choice if using certain machine learning frameworks.
- **R**: A language who's main purpose *is* data science. It is older in the data science community and quite popular in that community.

Android development:

- **Kotlin**: Google switched to Kotlin as the official language for Android app programming in 2017. It's simpler than Java with extensive libraries for Android development.
- **Java**: The original official Android app programming language. Is an extremely established language with a huge community.

iOS development:

- **Swift**: Apple launched Swift in 2014 specifically for iOS development and it has been growing in popularity ever since.
- **Objective-C**: The original iOS language. Still widely used, especially in older, established applications.

Video game development:

- **C++**: A very *fast* language, popular in creating game engines as well as games themselves.
- **C#**: A higher level language that is extremely popular in video game scripting.
- **JavaScript**: Very popular in creating games that are hosted in web browsers as well as on mobile platforms.
- **Java**: A versatile language that is popular in a range of games including Minecraft.

Embedded systems and IoT:

- **C++**: It is a fairly low-level language, with good libraries support that make it popular language for embedded systems, and it is *fast* when written well.
- **C**: A low level language that is extremely *fast* and is the language beneath the hood for many other languages like **python**. Many embedded systems are written directly in **C**.
- **Python**: with the advent of sub-languages like **micropython** that make python smaller and fit well with embedded systems, python has growing popularity in the embedded systems space, especially because it is often considered an easier language to work with than **C++** or **C**.

### Just pick one and stick with it for a while

Here's the biggest secret when it comes to picking your first language. **It really doesn't matter all that much which language you first choose.** All the languages out there (at least the more popular ones) are pretty good. And in the end, they all do pretty similar things. For the most part, they all have the same components: **grammar**, **types**, **variables**, **loops**, **conditional statements**, **functions** (if you don't know any of those terms, don't worry about it, there's plenty of time to learn üòâ). There are some differences in language components and structure (for example object oriented languages vs functional languages). But mostly the differences come down to grammar subtleties and external helper libraries available to the language. For the most part, **once you learn one language, it becomes very easy to learn a a second language**, and easier still to learn a third.

So don't stress too hard about that first language choice. The most important thing you are learning when first learning to code is how to use those underlying components (the **variables**, **loops**, etc.) that all languages have anyways. My one recommendation is to stick to that first language for a while -- at least until you feel comfortable writing in it. Finish a course in it, create a project in it. Switching away from that first language too early will just distract you from learning those core concepts common to all programming languages that are the important things to learn.

### Language choice conclusions

To conclude, **any** of the above-listed languages would make a great choice as a first programming language. There are plenty of job opportunities for any of the above-listed languages, especially as remote work becomes more popular. Things to consider include the language popularity and what you want to use it for. But in the end, the choice really doesn't matter as much as you think it does. Just pick one and stick to it so you can learn the underlying tools common to all programming languages. It'll be easy enough to switch languages later on, once you understand the fundamentals common to all programming languages.

I picked Python. It is very popular and pretty-to-look at with a simple-to-learn style. It can handle really complex projects, has a wide range of jobs it's good at, and has a really great community. But you might choose JavaScript because you want to learn how to make awesome front-end web applications, or you might choose Swift because you are really interested in making iphone apps. Just do a little research and pick one. And whatever you choose, don't stress. They're all good, and you can always change later on.

## Getting started

Okay, you've decided you are going to start your coding **self-education** journey, and you've picked a programming language. Where do we go from there? The options are overwhelming, how do you even get started? My best advice here is, **just do *something***.

It is *really* hard to know what learning path is right for you when you are first getting started. So I recommend just code *something* to start learning what is right for you. The more you code, the more you'll learn what works for you. You're never going to have a perfect lesson plan out the gate. Promise yourself right now, "I'm going to spend an hour coding on *X* platform." It doesn't really matter what resource you are using to code with. The hardest part is just breaking that deadlock in your mind and deciding you're going to code *something*. At the end of that hour, re-evaluate. Maybe that means keep doing what you were doing and check in after another hour -- the course your taking or the coding game you're playing is interesting and you want to keep exploring it. Maybe that means take a break today, but tomorrow you have something new to research based on what you learned coding for that hour. As they say "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Take that first step and every step thereafter will be easier.

Start doing *something*? Teddy, that's pretty vague. Do you have any suggestions that are more specific? Sure. Here are a few resources that might be a nice first get-your-toes-wet introduction to coding.

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }: This is a cool website that offers coding classes in the browser. You can take interactive courses in languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java** and a variety of others. Create a free account, pick a language, and start taking that introductory class.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }: This is another, similar awesome website that offers a variety of free interactive courses you can take directly on their website.
- [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }: Video games more your speed? This is an awesome website where you learn to code while playing a dungeon crawler video game. Type code commands in order to move your hero through perilous dungeons and slay your foes.
- [General Assembly course](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/){: target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" }: General Assembly is a company that offers courses, many of which are live, most of which cost money. However they have a really nice introduction to web development course that is on-demand and free.

That's just a couple resources I've tried out that I think are perfect for getting your feet wet with programming. And you don't have to finish any of them to get value. Just starting an interactive course or game will get you started on that path to learning and will get you excited to learn more!
