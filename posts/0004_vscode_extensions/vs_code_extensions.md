## Introduction

VS CODE IMAGE

VS Code (VisualStudio Code) was released in 2015 and in the years since,
it has become one of the most popular text editors on the market. What has
led to that popularity? It is **free**, light weight, has a beautiful and
intuitive user interface and it's fully customizable through **extensions**.
Extensions can bring nearly any look or functionality you like to VS Code.
